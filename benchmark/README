This sample script runs a model composed of a single, non-reactive
species. After each run, the script prints the real time it took
to run the simulation in seconds. This script may be useful for
a simple benchmarking purpose.

T: time when simulation is stopped.
V: the volume of the space used in the simulation.
N: the number of particles in the simulator volume.
D: Diffusion coefficient = 1e-12 [m^2/s]
R: Radius of particles = 2.5e-9 [m]

Periodic boundary
After N particles are randomly placed, the simulator runs
for some small duration of time (stirTime in the script) to stir.
After that, the simulator is re-initialized, and run for T
to take the benchmark.
